## Introduction

Cord3 is an attempt to build a system similar to [Trello](http://www.trello.com).

At the moment there is minimal functionality and the planned 'system' has not been developed as of yet. The 'system' - the software that will make everything work - is going to be developed in PHP and MySQL.

## Installation

```No installation instructions```

## Helping Out**

We want people to get excited about Cord3 and the development process. Why?

 * Cord3 has the potential to become a powerful enterprise tool
 * RMG Software is currently working on developing a complete 'Road Map' for Cord3
 * Is completely **FREE** And it always will be.
